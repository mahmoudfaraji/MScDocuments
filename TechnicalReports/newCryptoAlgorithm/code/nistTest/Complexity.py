        The focus of this test is the length of a linear feedback shift register (LFSR). The purpose of this test is to
        determine whether or not the sequence is complex enough to be considered random. Random sequences are
        characterized by longer LFSRs. An LFSR that is too short implies non-randomness.

        The Berlekamp–Massey algorithm is an algorithm that will find the shortest linear feedback shift register (LFSR)
        for a given binary output sequence. The algorithm will also find the minimal polynomial of a linearly recurrent
        sequence in an arbitrary field. The field requirement means that the Berlekamp–Massey algorithm requires all
